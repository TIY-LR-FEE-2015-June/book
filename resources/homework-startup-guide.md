# Homework Preflight Checklist

When starting on new homework assignments things can get a bit tough.
These notes will not tell you the exact commands that you will need to run, but it will at least list out the different steps so you know what you are missing.

1. Create a new issue in the [class assignments repo](https://github.com/tiy-lr-fee-2015-June/assignments)
    * Create todos for all listed requirements
1. Create a new directory for the day's assignment
2. Make sure that your shell is in the newly created folder
3. Initialize a new git repo in the assignment directory
4. Create boiler plate files needed for the assignment
    * [HTML Boilerplate](../week-1/day-1/html-review.html#boilerplate-valid-html)
    * [CSS border-box](http://www.paulirish.com/2012/box-sizing-border-box-ftw/)
5. Stage boilerplate files
6. Commit boilerplate files
7. Create repository on Github
8. Push local git repo with boilerplate to new Github (should be your `master` branch)
9. Create and checkout new `develop` branch for new changes on top of the existing boilerplate
10. Get to your first stopping point
11. Stage and commit changes to `develop`
12. Push `develop` branch to Github
13. Make a new Pull Request from `develop` to `master` on your Github repository

Remember to update your todo checkboxes in your issue so that I can track your progress and see where we may have some things to work on for the next day!
