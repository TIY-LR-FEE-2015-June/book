# Monday July 13

Today we started working on learning the basics of Javascript with the DOM:

## Outline

* Javascript & the DOM
    - `document.getElementById` - returns one `HTMLElement`
    - `document.getElementsByClass` - returns a collection of `HTMLElement`
    - `HTMLElement.innerHTML` - get or set text of an HTML Element
    - `HTMLElement.onclick` - set this to a function and that function will run whenever a user clicks on that element
* Git
    - `git clone`
    - `hub create <repo_name>` - Creates a repo on Github for you
    - `hub remote add <remote_name>` - Adds a remote to your local repo and names it based on a repo for your Github user and then the current folder name.
