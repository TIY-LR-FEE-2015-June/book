# Monday July 13

Today we started working on learning the basics of Javascript:

## Outline

* Variables
* Functions
* Maths

## Lab

Today in lab I showed you a bit of how I would approach building some CSS for a site given some design photos.

The site that I built was [opendesk](http://opendesk.cc/).

## Homework

Tomorrow morning I will be reviewing, grading, and pulling up assignments 1.1-1.4 in class.
This is your last chance to get these in and ask questions on them.
We need to make sure that we have the homework turn in process locked down so that we can continue forward and start looking at our next assignments.

While I expect all homework to be DONE and TURNED IN, your mental priorities should be (in this order):

* [1.4](https://github.com/TIY-LR-FEE-2015-June/assignments/tree/master/1.4-tshirts) - Complete assignment and make the grid layout responsive at screen sizes below 480px
* [1.3](https://github.com/TIY-LR-FEE-2015-June/assignments/tree/master/1.3-iron-news) - Complete assignment along with dropdown menu and zebra stripes
* [1.2](https://github.com/TIY-LR-FEE-2015-June/assignments/tree/master/1.2-layout-basic) - Complete assignment and make the grid layout responsive at screen sizes below 480px
* [1.1](https://github.com/TIY-LR-FEE-2015-June/assignments/tree/master/1.1-basic-git-pr) - Complete and make any changes noted in my comments
