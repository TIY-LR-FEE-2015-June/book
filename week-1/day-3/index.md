# Summary

Today we looked at how we can create column layouts as well as position elements in more ways than we can do with `position` or `margin` alone.
From there we also looked at using our first Pseudo-selectors: `:before` and `:after`.

# Homework

Based on the exercise that we started in class, continue working recreating the layout from Hackernews.
