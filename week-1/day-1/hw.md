For today's assignment we went through the requirements listed at the root of the Assignments repo which will apply to all assignments going forward, as well as the specifics for today's homework.

As many of you have finished the listed assignment on github take some time tonight to go through the Treehouse course on "Git Basics".
Treehouse has a 14 day trial (just remember to cancel before they charge for the first month because it can be a bit pricey).
