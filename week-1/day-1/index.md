# Monday June 29

Today we finished working on the final sections of the Day 0 intall procedure ([zsh](../day-0/zsh.html) & [other](../day-0/other.html)).
Then we started to review the basics of what is git, why do we use it, and how can we start creating our first project.
Next we briefly reviewed HTML, some basic boilerplate to start out websites.
We wrapped up the class by walking through the steps of making issues, repositories, and pull requests on Github in order to turn in homework assignments.
