# Typing Skills

Through this course we will be typing out a ton of code in our exercises, challenges, homework, and projects.
You will need to be very comfortable around the keyboard becuase we will be learning keyboard shortcuts and you won't always be able to rely on muscle memory for usual words (code doesn't quite flow the same way that prose does).

If you feel the need to look at your keyboard when usually typing, try out [keybr.com](http://www.keybr.com/#!game) which allows you practice touch typing.

Once you are comfortable with touch typing, I recommend trying out the Javascript exercises on [typing.io](https://typing.io/)(the free plan will work just fine).
You will find that typing code is pretty different than working with normal email and web searching.
