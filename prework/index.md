# Prework Introduction

Before we can really get moving, there are some base skills that are needed to keep up with the pace that we have planned for you.
These assignments should be completed before starting class if possible, and these resources should be fairly self guided 
Please [email me](mailto:ryan@theironyard.com) if you have any questions or are having problems completing an assignment and I will be happy to help you.

We will start class assuming that everyone has completed these prework assignments, and if you are unable to finish them, you will likely feel like you are far behind.

To complete this prework, you will need to sign up for [codecademy.com](codecademy), these are free courses and are a great way to get up and running and at least this will get you comfortable with some of the syntax we will be covering.

## What Now?

Continue to follow through this chapter of prework and I will see you in class!

> Though the chances are slim, there is a chance that we may need to reinstall OSX from fresh and I would hate for personal documents or family photos to be lost because of this.
