# Learning The Basics: HTML & CSS

We will be covering HTML and CSS more in depth during the first week of class, but this is the foundation for everything we will be doing through the following twelve weeks.
This being said, there is a lot of fun stuff that we want to be able to do in our course, so the more familiar with HTML and CSS you are: the less time we will have to spend reviewing and we will be able to cover more advanced topics and techniques.

To get started learning HTML and CSS please complete the [Web Track on CodeCademy](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web). This should take about 6-7 hours depending on your current experience and general comfort typing and working on your computer.
