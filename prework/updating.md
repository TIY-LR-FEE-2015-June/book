# Updating your Operating System

To make sure that everyone is on the same page, we will be using OSX Yosemite 10.10.3 or greater.

Before coming to class (and if possible before starting other prework), please update your computer to the latest version of OSX Yosemite.
This will make things much easier and will allow me to best replicate and figure out any issues that may come up in class.

**WARNING:** Upgrades on OSX are usually pretty good about not losing data, but just like any time you are modifying the operating system. I recommend that you backup your computer and documents using Time Machine and Dropbox.

## The Update Process

  1.  You'll need to sign in to the Mac App Store with you Apple ID. If you
      don't have one, [sign up here](https://appleid.apple.com/).
  2.  Download the Yosemite upgrade from the Apple Store: [download
      here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/os-x-yosemite/id915041082?mt=12).
  3.  Double-click "Install OS X Yosemite‚Äù to begin installation.

**WARNING:** The OS X upgrade can take a bit of time to complete and will require a
restart. Plan on doing this in the evening or over a lunch break.
