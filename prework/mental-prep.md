# Getting in the Learning Mode

Through this course, we will be moving at a very quick pace and this does take a bit of a shift thinking about learning new things.
Checkout this video and article that discuss the ability to keep improving:

- [Fixed vs. Growth: The Two Basic Mindsets That Shape Our Lives](http://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/)
- [The power of believing that you can improve](http://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve?language=en)

We will discuss some of this the first week and how it will effect the pace and work for the course.
