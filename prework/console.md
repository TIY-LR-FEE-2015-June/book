# Learning The Basics: Console Commands

Through this course we will be using the console a lot.
Between build tools and file management being comfortable in the console is a must.
You don't need to be an expert from day one, but should be able to do a few basic tasks:

- Print the Current Directory
- Move through the file system
- List files in a directory
- Create new files
- Delete files and folders
- Opening files with default programs
- Opening files with basic editors (nano or vi)
- Move files
- Pipes and the `cat` command

There are a few different resources that you can use to learn these skills:

- [Command Line Power User - Command Line Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DP218aBHm1Q&list=PLu8EoSxDXHP7tXPJp5ZmUpuT7sFvrswzf&index=2) - Screencast covering most of the above commands
- [Lifehacker - Command Line Primer For Beginners](http://lifehacker.com/5633909/who-needs-a-mouse-learn-to-use-the-command-line-for-almost-anything#) - Written article

## Supplemental

Team Treehouse also has a few courses covering console commands.
These aren't required and are a bit slower paced than the two links above.
If you do not feel comfortable accomplishing the above goals, watch the courses below (they can take 2-3 hours depending on your comfort from the first two articles):
