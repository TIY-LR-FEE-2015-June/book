# Backbone In Depth

* Sometimes it's unclear why some things are capitalized and others are not.
* We HAVE to create an instance of the component before we can use it
* Still not sure what `_.extend` does
    - Pull up in annotated source
    - Build two objects on the white board
    - Pretend to do `_.extend`
* Is there anything in Backbone that 'replaces' jQuery / JavaScript?
    - No, Backbone USES jQuery
* As far as JS is concerned all Jquery, underscore, backbone and other tools are just there to make JS function better and more user friendly?
* How often is Backbone used in the "real world"?
    - 
* Model vs Collection vs View
* Glue Code...?
* Scoping Queries and efficiency
    - $ vs $el
* Not sure what this REST/RESTful API stuff means
    - What is REST?
    - Is REST part of AJAX (asynchronous JavaScript and XML)
* Does backbone just provide a streamlined way to pull, modify, add, and remove data?
* What is a promise object? (.then)
