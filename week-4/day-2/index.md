# Tuesday July 21

Today we once again looked at Javascript variables, functions, `Array.prototype.forEach`, and Handlebars.
In lab we started talking about Javascript prototype, objects, `this`, and inheritance.


## Outline

## Homework

Tonight I want you to read the above linked article.
Also, since we've been piling larger homework assignments, you should take this day to get caught up: focus on Handlebars, `forEach`, and Javascript DOM concepts (I'm gonna be moving forward assuming that we have this nailed since we've reviewed it two days in a row now).
