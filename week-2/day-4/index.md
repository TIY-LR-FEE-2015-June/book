# Wednesday July 8

Today we started looking at using `broccoli.js` as a build tool and pipeline in our projects.
We introduced Live Reload and SASS as ways to help speed up and make our development process a bit more sane.

## Outline

* [Broccoli Build to Output Files](../day-3/broccoli.html)
* [Bourbon](bourbon.html)
* [SASS Configuration](../day-3/sass.html)
* [Better SASS Variables](../day-3/sass.html)
* [GH Pages (put it on the web DAWG)](https://gist.github.com/rtablada/50ab1d84b0e3f9c476d7)
